This is the first time user testing, we held this test session in Room 209, Building 78.  
We invited 5 students from school of EAIT, and the whole testing process last one hour and half.  
The test based on the prototype demo 1 and 2. We use two laptops and display two demo at the same time,  
to let users know what's the update from demo 1 to demo 2, and ask some suggestions about these update.  
Users gave some useful feedback about updates and suggestions for futhure update.

Feedback:

Students version:  
1. When new users finish sign up, should have some recommendations about news category.
2. Should have a friends recommendation like Facebook.
3. Navigationbar is confusing and should change.
4. Instant chat function is not necessary on homepage, can alternative to the Friends page.
5. Comment from students or enterprise needs to be distinguished

enterprise version:
1. When sign up finished, friends and news recommendations should comes up like students version.  
2. Activity page is confusing and needs explaination.
3. How students join activity.
4. Users could see how many people join activity and which is the polupar.
5. User could add friends like students users.

After the first time testing, we found out many problems. And wo also needs to refine our concept,  
focus on some functions and discuss which section needs change.
Finally, for horiaontal and vertical dedsign, which one is important for our project is also need discussion.
