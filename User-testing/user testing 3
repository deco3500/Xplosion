In the latest user testing, five users participate this session,   
including two communication school students who have been in our first-time user testing.  

We held this test session in Room 209 Building 78 and processed for one and a half hour.  
In this test session, we used the latest version prototype.  
Jolly updated the low-fidelity digital prototype and made a high-fidelity type contains all functions we've  achieved.  
Herman held the session and arranged the testing time for every participant. Lenny was in charge of users' feedback and suggestions. 
In the process of testing, all participants showed their interests to this prototype. They like the UI, functions, layout, and so on.

Meanwhile, someone gave some suggestions for this prototype:  

1. Order of version identification page needs change.  
2. "edit together" function should achieve  
3. Articles can be shared both in students and enterprise version.

We will update our prototype before the final delivery, and finish all details in the prototype,  
as well as the senario for prototype using.
