This is the second time user testing, we've invited 5 students from school of EAIT and Communication,
and we held the testing in Room 209 Building 78. The prototype tested this time is based on demo 3 and 4.  
Users test the updates from demo 3 to demo 4.  
After two hours testing session, we received some useful feedback listed below:

students verison:

1. Homepage should be more attractive(color and functions).
2. Homepage "post news" button should be cancled, it may cause confusing for users.
3. Homepage filter: should be changed to dropdown list, save space for reading.
4. Homepage friends list: should be hidden in normal type, and shown when mouse hover its area.
5. Friends page: Net style is good but need explainations.
6. My work and Achievement page: combine, and create category for "published", "unpublished(draft, submitted)".
7. Activity page: should achieve.

enterprise version:

1.News source: should be cancled, because it causes confusing.
2.Home page: should be the rating page for quick scan.
3.Favorite news: for saving the articles that user liked in the rating page.

According the feedback, we'll design a hi-fi prototype which will make a huge update based on those feedback.
