Meeting with Professor Skye:  

Before the first standup, we got a chance to meet with Skye.   
Within the meeting, we asked many questions about students and enterprise and got satisfying answers.   
Skye also did a test with our first prototype and gave us some suggestions.  

1. When talking about the user value to both students and news enterprises,  
we found that our user research in project proposal is not efficient and convincing.   
Therefore, we start to process additional user value in next week.   
Moreover, we decide to use questioners and interviews because it can get large data and feedback from our users.  

2.For the journalist users in real life, we have this understanding that they are always busy with their jobs,  
and usually read news sources with their piecemeal time.   
So, we decide to design a "quick rate" function for the enterprise version.   
Journalists can easily click "like" and "dislike" button to save news to their like list or discard this news.   
Users are benefited from this function because it can help them save lots of time.   
Moreover, "like list" is convenient for journalists to have an intensive reading.  

3.What's more, Skye also suggests us to focus more on social and interactive functions.   
All UI design needs consideration of value for users before the final decision. 
In the progress of the first standup, we repeat our concept and talk about some details about our prototype such as "friend" and "activity" function.   
We talk about our plan for next week and ask suggestions for our user value survey.   
Feh is very kindly to advise us to implement this survey through Slack and other social platforms.  

Before next standup, we have three milestones to reach.  

1. Finish the questioner and post it to Slack and some available platform, then we collect and analyze data.  

2. Do some additional research on user value.  

3.  Update our prototype and record new functions and why we need this update.
