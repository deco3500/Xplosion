##1. Introduction:
##2. Concept descrption:
###2.1. Idea brief:
MyNews is an application, which designed for the journalism students and news corporation. This application bridges the gap between the journalism students and news corporation.

Firstly,  It could provide the journalism students with a chance to approach the news companies. Moreover, it allows students to develop their professional skills through practising in this application.  Furthermore, the students could gain feedback from professional people working in the news companies. On the other hand, it could give the news companies an opportunity to explore potential reporters or journalist at the various universities. Additionally, the companies also could enrich their news source.  

Secondly, this application is similar to the social platform as well. There is a timeline recorded the successful publishing news for the students. And friends could leave a comment each other. 

Thirdly, users also could use this application to browse the news. Thus, the students can also learn from the other students, because the news is from the students around the world. 
###2.2. Target audience:
Obviously, there are two main target user groups of this application - Jurnalism students and News corporation. 
###2.3. Purpose:
###2.4. Team Goals:
####Functional:
Our basic goal is to build a functional application and ensure every feature and workflow function well. To achieve this goal, we will put more efforts on the design stage to avoid design bugs, which if exist will cost more time to fix after all the programming work is done. Also, we will leave at least a week for testing before releasing the project.
 
####User-friendly Interface:
Interface will give the user the first impression of the application, which is quite important to the decision that if they are willing to use it at the first place. Moreover, a neat interface will help to create a good mood and user experience while the user are struggling solving the puzzles.
 
####Good Performance:
We expect every team member contributes their best performance as for this type of application, we have to ensure each functions running smoothly. Besides, we are expected to make sure at least 10 people could access and use our application at the same time within a proper response time.
###2.5. Conceptual model
Firstly, users need to set up through a real name system. This means they need to input their real name, student ID, school name, company name and so on. Then, they need to select their identity. If the user is a student, the application will lead the user to the student version. If the user is the news corporation, the application will guide the user to the corporation version. 

From the student's version perspective, students could edit their profile and send requests to add friends. Additionally, they could browse news feeds that published successfully by the companies. They could leave a comment below the news as well. Furthermore, the students could take or upload a picture or a video with a description and send it to this application. Those data will be sent to a news pool - a database so that the companies could search or browse the news from the news pool. Finally, the students can participate the activity hold by the news companies; the activity is not compulsory. 

From the news corporation perspective, the news companies could browse the news in the news pool, and decide which news could be re-edited and published. The companies also could enrich their news source by searching in the news pool. That news published successfully will appear on the timeline of the author in their homepage. Also, the companies need to give students feedback helping them develop. Furthermore, the companies could hold activities by this application. They could give a specific theme to students and get the information they want. As a result, they can find the potential reporter or journalist. 

For security, they will be a censorship and monitoring regime to check the content. Besides, it also can check article similarity to avoid plagiarism.  

The article needs to be added keyword tags in order to easy searching, and there are also some categories like political, life, sport and so on to classify the news. 

If serval companies select the same topic but from different students, what should we do?
 Those articles can be published because the students can compare their own article and others. 
If several companies select the same articles at the same time, what should we do?
 May the first comes, the first service (can continue to come up with other solutions). 

##3. Team:
####Team Members & Roles:
He Zhao-Product Manager who will lead the team and manage the project. Besides, he will be responsible for logistics. E.g. writing and collating meeting minutes; borrowing equipment; contacting with parities, etc. 
Xi Chen-UI/UX Designer. She will mainly focus on interface design and usability optimization 
Junming Xu-Project Programmer who will take charge of the whole technique section of the project. He will decide which programming language would be used for build our application and fix all kinds of functional issues.

####Decision Making:
#####UI:
The UI design idea will be generated by the designer and other team members should also raise their ideas to improve the project. The final decision of UI design should be approved by product manager.

#####Technical solution:
Product manager proposes performance requirements in product level. The web developers offer specific technical path, and illustrate the reason. After determining all required materials and information, we will work on a small demo based on that solution, so the product manager can make a final decision on product development.

#####Other issues:
If anyone has problems, they should raise questions in the group meeting or any group communication channels such as Facebook, Group Chat machine and Email. The product manager has the responsibility to make final decision based on results of team discussions.

####Task Division:
Tasks will be allocated fairly through group discussion and will be allocated based on the strengths of each member. Group members are expected to contribute their best efforts on the project and deliver tasks on time. If a team member is unable to finish tasks, he/she should contact the group and ask other group members to help. For a situation that a team member is consistently unable to complete their tasks, the task will be redistributed amongst other team members and a formal notice will be made to tutors/course co-ordinator.

####Dispute Resolution:
#####Group Member Dropout
In the event that a group member leaves the group, their workload will be redistributed between remaining group members. The redistribution should attempt to be fair, but also take the skills and commitments of remaining members into consideration.

#####Group Conflicts and Solution
In the event of significant conflicts between group members, any disputes will be resolved by a majority vote between all group members. If no majority consensus can be reached, then the team can send an email to the course coordinator to solve this issue.

##4. Communications:
Group meetings will be held after our lecture at Monday 12:00AM – 2:00OPM in Building 78. Besides, there will be a team discussion during Friday’s workshop in Building 50. All members are expected to attend and join within group discussion. Meetings are subject only to illness or other unavoidable personal commitments.
 
Commitments include:
1.    Work obligations
2.    Family emergency
3.    Other university submissions
4.    Unforeseen circumstances (e.g. accidents, traffic, extreme weather)
 
If someone is not able to attend the meeting, other group members should notify him the meeting summary as soon as possible via email or Facebook. A phone call is only used for emergencies. An additional meeting can be held when it’s necessary, arranged once a week and to ensure everyone can attend that meeting. The group will maintain regular contact outside of these meetings via email, Facebook and phone. Although the lecturer recommends us forming a Slack group as our social platform, we think Slack is not very convenient to use. Because the app doesn’t allow users to log on multiple groups at the same time, users might not receive timely notification. Additionally, everyone has a Facebook account, so we believe it’s easier to use Facebook for communication.

As for file sharing, we would like to use Google Drive, because it allows the whole group edit the same file simultaneously, and it can automatically store files on the cloud. All files will be named based on assignment requirement. If there is no particular naming convention, the file would be named after related milestones or corresponding tasks, such as “Proposal. pdf” or “Paper prototype design and implementation.pdf”.
