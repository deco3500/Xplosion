###2.1. Idea brief:
MyNews is an application, which designed for the journalism students and news corporation. This application bridges the gap between the journalism students and news corporation.

Firstly,  It could provide the journalism students with a chance to approach the news companies. Moreover, it allows students to develop their professional skills through practising in this application.  Furthermore, the students could gain feedback from professional people working in the news companies. On the other hand, it could give the news companies an opportunity to explore potential reporters or journalist at the various universities. Additionally, the companies also could enrich their news source.  

Secondly, this application is similar to the social platform as well. There is a timeline recorded the successful publishing news for the students. And friends could leave a comment each other. 

Thirdly, users also could use this application to browse the news. Thus, the students can also learn from the other students, because the news is from the students around the world.
