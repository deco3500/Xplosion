After the last standup, we reviewed our concept and set three small goals to this stands up.   
The first goal is to find the value of the concept. This work should be in the research stage.   
However, this is our flaw of the research stage. The second goal is to conduct a testing session.   
This helps us get some useful feedback and promote us improve our prototype. The third goal is to develop a new version of the prototype.  

We followed our plan, and we did have some achievement.   
Firstly, we spread out the questionnaire to our target user. However, we did not get any reply.   
Secondly, we tested four users. And we get some useful feedback from them. We will take the suggestions like combine "My work" and "achievement" together,   
and the homepage should be straightforward and clear and show them in next prototype.   
Thirdly, we developed a new version of the prototype, and we tested Feh in the workshop session.   
Feh gave us lots of useful feedback. One good point is to set a testing task flow (scenario) in next testing session.   
It is because that can show the core functionality to the users. Another good point is the friends should be collaborative, and we may present this relationship in our product.   
Lastly, do not show too many features. 

Here is a small plan before next stand up.   

1. Consider the feedback and develop a new and higher fidelity prototype by using other software such as Wix. 
(1) The new prototype should show the collaborative feature.
(2) The interface should be more logical and straightforward enough. 

2. Write a test task flow or create a scenario to testing the core functionality of the product. The core functionality is social.   
To be more specific, firstly, the students could edit the news by individual or with others.   
Secondly, the students could share the published news with their friends, and they also could create a new topic group to discuss the sample news with their friends.   
Thirdly, the students could get the feedback from the journalist.   
Fourthly, the journalist could decide which article could be published and also could share the news with their friends. 



Here are some articles we have read from last stands up. Some of them are helpful.
