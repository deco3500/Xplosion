Before this stand-up, we have achieved our process goals:  

1. Update our project and use Wix to create a more interactive demo.  

2. Process a user test, and got some helpful feedback.

In the latest project demo, we add some collaborative features: "cooperative edit",  
when users edit their article, they can invite friends to edit together,   
like the Google Doc, which allows many people edit one article simultaneously.  

In the stand-up, Feh tested our prototype and gave some useful suggestions both for the prototype and also the final presentation.  
For the prototype, two problems.   
The first one is the color theme of the layout.   
We use purple as the background color; it will give users a feeling of insipid visually.  
And we discuss this and decide to change different color in the different page to attract users eyes and make the whole site beautiful and logical.
The second problem is category problems.   
In the "History", it shows every activity happen with user's account,  
including comment, feedback, news published, friend invitation and all these records are listed by time.   
This may cause a hinder when user searches a specific message. And Feh advice us build a category for the quick scan, which is good advice.

For the preparation of the final presentation, Feh also gives some suggestions through testing the prototype.
The first one is the marketing strategies.  
We need to suppose that our project can be released and make a profit.   
So, how to convince buyers to invest our product. We need to do market research including users value and comparisons with the similar product.
The second one is every function needs reason to reflect its feature.   
Take "Friends" page as an example, why we use the friends net as the design style?   
Because users can see friend number and interaction frequency with them directly on this page,   
also can chat and send a message or go their profile page and some other functions on the social platform.  
  
  In the next week, we have three tasks to go.  
  
1. Finish the prototype and do some user testing.  

2. Design a scenario for a better presentation and make some tasks for users when processing test.  

3. Finish promotional materials and design a video to show how the product work.
