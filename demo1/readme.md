According to the project proposal, we design our first prototype with "Balsamiq Mockup", and we also link all pages and buttons in this mockup. 
There are two versions (students & enterprise) in this mockup. Two buttons link to the different login or signup page. Both students and companies staff must signup with real name and institution.

Both versions have a news scan page, which displays different content. In student version, what students can see from news scan page is other users' articles. Meanwhile, journalists can browse all posted news by other colleagues or students. 

In student version, users can post news articles (by click submit button) or save as draft (by click save button). They can edit all items they saved or posted. And check comments and feedback from both students and journalists. Within achievement page, students can see all published articles by news companies and comments from other students.Friends function is designed for chatting. Users can add friends through articles display. And we still work on it to make it easy to find and use.

In the enterprise version, there is a "release activity" function for enterprise releasing new activities. And students can join their interested activity.And journalists can see details and author's profile in the particular news page. Journalists also can add students as their friend and check their news articles anytime.
